**Isaac Lab** is a GPU-accelerated, open-source framework designed to unify and simplify robotics research workflows, such as reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and motion planning. Built on [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/index.html), it combines fast and accurate physics and sensor simulation, making it an ideal choice for sim-to-real transfer in robotics.

Isaac Lab provides developers with a range of essential features for accurate sensor simulation, such as RTX-based cameras, LIDAR, or contact sensors. The framework's GPU acceleration enables users to run complex simulations and computations faster, which is key for iterative processes like reinforcement learning and data-intensive tasks. Moreover, Isaac Lab can run locally or be distributed across the cloud, offering flexibility for large-scale deployments.
